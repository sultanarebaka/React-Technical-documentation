			<p>React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. If you don’t feel very confident, we recommend going through a JavaScript tutorial to check your knowledge level and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re learning both React and JavaScript at the same time. <br> <br> JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started. Why JSX?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.</li>


<li> Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.</li>


<li>React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual
 aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.</li>
</ul>

<section class="main-section"

			<h1>What you should already know</h1>
			<p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
			<ul>

<li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
				<li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
				<li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript and React.</li>

<section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
			<h1>Hello world</h1>
			<p>The smallest React example looks like this:</p>
			
<p>It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="introducingjsx">
      <header><h1>Introducing JSX</h1></header>
      <p>Consider this variable declaration:</p>


<pre>
<code>

const element = < h1 >Hello, world!< /h1 > &emsp;<br>
      </code> </pre>
      <p>
        This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.<br><br>

		<section class="main-section" id="rendering_elements">
      <header><h1>Rendering Elements</h1></header>
			<p>Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.</p>
      <p>An element describes what you want to see on the screen:</p>

      <pre>
      <code>
        const element = < h1>Hello, world< /h1>; <br>
      </code></pre>
     <p>Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.</p>
      
		</section> <br>

<section class="main-section" id="components_props">
      <header><h1>Components and Props</h1></header>
			<p>Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a detailed component API reference here.<br><br>

Conceptually, components 


 like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.</p>

<p>The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:</p>
      
			<pre>
				<code>
        function Welcome(props) {
        return < h1>Hello, {props.name}< /h1>;
        }
        </code>
      </pre>

</section><br>
<section class="main-section" id="state_lifecycle">
      <header><h1>State and Lifecycle</h1></header>
			<p>This page introduces the concept of state and lifecycle in a React component. You can find a detailed component API reference here.<br><br>


Consider the ticking clock example from one of the previous sections. In Rendering Elements, we have only learned one way to update the UI. We call ReactDOM.render() to change the rendered output:</p>

<pre>
<code>
function tick() {
          const element = (
    < div>
      < h1 >Hello, world!< /h1>
      < h2 >It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.< /h2 >
    < /div>
    );
    ReactDOM.render(
     element,
     document.getElementById('root')
   );
 }



setInterval(tick, 1000);
				 </code> </pre> 
		
		</section> <br>

	<section class="main-section" id="handling_events">
      <header><h1>Handling Events</h1></header>
			<p>Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntactic differences:<br> 
<ul>
<li>React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.</li>
<li>With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.</li></ul><br>
For example, the HTML:</p>
    <pre>  
    <code>

<button onclick="activateLasers()">
      Activate Lasers </button>
      </code>
      <p>is slightly different in React:</p>
      <code>
        < button onClick={activateLasers}>
        Activate Lasers
        < /button>

      </code></pre>
